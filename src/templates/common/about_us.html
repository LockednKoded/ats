        <b>Airports Authority of India (AAI)</b> manages a total of 125 Airports, which include 11 International
        Airports,
        08 Customs Airports, 81 Domestic Airports and 25 Civil Enclaves at Defence Airfields. AAI also provides Air
        Traffic Management Services (ATMS) over entire Indian Air Space and adjoining oceanic areas with ground
        installations at all Airports and 25 other locations to ensure safety of Aircraft operations.</p>

    <p>The Airports at Ahmedabad, Amritsar, Calicut, Guwahati, Jaipur, Trivandrum, Kolkata & Chennai, which today
        are established as International Airports, are open to operations even by Foreign International Airlines.
        Besides, the International flights, National Flag Carriers operate from Coimbatore, Tiruchirappalli,
        Varanasi, and Gaya Airports. Not only this but also the Tourist Charters now touch Agra, Coimbatore, Jaipur,
        Lucknow, Patna Airports etc.</p>

    <p>AAI has entered into a Joint Venture at Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Nagpur Airports to upgrade
        these Airports and emulate the world standards.</p>

    <p>All major air-routes over Indian landmass are Radar covered (29 Radar installations at 11 locations) along
        with VOR/DVOR coverage (89 installations) co-located with Distance Measuring Equipment (90 installations).
        52 runways are provided with ILS installations with Night Landing Facilities at most of these Airports and
        Automatic Message Switching System at 15 Airports.</p>

    <p>AAI's successful implementation of Automatic Dependence Surveillance System (ADSS), using indigenous
        technology, at Calcutta and Chennai Air Traffic Control Centres, gave India the distinction of being the
        first country to use this advanced technology in the South East Asian region thus enabling effective Air
        Traffic Control over oceanic areas using satellite mode of communication. Use of remote controlled VHF
        coverage, along with satellite communication links, has given added strength to our ATMS. Linking of 80
        locations by V-Sat installations shall vastly enhance Air Traffic Management and in turn safety of aircraft
        operations besides enabling administrative and operational control over our extensive Airport network.
        Performance Based Navigation (PBN) procedures have already been implemented at Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad
        Airports and are likely to be implemented at other Airports in phased manner.</p>

    <p>AAI has undertaken GAGAN project in technological collaboration with Indian Space and Research Organization
        (ISRO), where the satellite based system will be used for navigation. The navigation signals thus received
        from the GPS will be augmented to achieve the navigational requirement of aircrafts. First Phase of
        technology demonstration system has already been successfully completed in February 2008. Development team
        has been geared up to upgrade the system in operational phase.</p>

    <p>AAI has also planned to provide Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) at Delhi and Mumbai Airports. This
        GBAS equipment will be capable of providing Category-II (curved approach) landing signals to the aircrafts
        thus replacing the existing instrument landing system in the long run, which is required at each end of the
        runway.</p>

    <p>The Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (ASMGCS), installed at Delhi, has upgraded
        operation to runway 28 from CAT-IIIA level to CAT-IIIB level. CAT-IIIA system permits landing of aircrafts
        up to visibility of 200mtrs. However, CAT-IIIB will permit safe landing at the Airports at a visibility
        below 200mtrs but above 50mtrs.</p>

    <p>AAI's endeavour, in enhanced focus on 'customer's expectations', has evinced enthusiastic response to
        independent agency, which has organised customer satisfaction surveys at 30 busy Airports. These surveys
        have enabled us to undertake improvements on aspects recommended by the Airport users. The receptacles for
        our 'Business Reply Letters' at Airports have gained popularity; these responses enable us to understand the
        changing aspirations of Airport users. During the first year of the millennium, AAI endeavours to make its
        operations more transparent and also make available the instantaneous information to customers by deploying
        state-of-art Information Technology.</p>

    <p>The specific training, focus on improving the employee response and the professional skill up-gradation, has
        been manifested. AAI's four training establishments viz. Civil Aviation Training College (CATC) - Allahabad,
        National Institute of Aviation Management and Research (NIAMAR) - Delhi and Fire Training Centres (FTCs) at
        Delhi & Kolkata are expected to be busier than ever before.</p>

    <p>AAI has also undertaken initiatives to upgrade training facilities at CATC Allahabad and Hyderabad Airport.
        Aerodrome Visual Simulator (AVS) has been provided at CATC recently and non-radar procedural ATC simulator
        equipment is being supplied to CATC Allahabad and Hyderabad Airport.</p>

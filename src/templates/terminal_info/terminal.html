  <h1>Airport Terminal</h1>
  <p>
      An airport terminal is a building at an airport. It is where passengers are able to get on and off aircraft.
      Inside the terminal, passengers can buy tickets, leave or pick up their luggage, and be checked by security staff.
      The buildings that provide access to the airplanes through gates are usually called concourses.
      However, the words "terminal" and "concourse" are sometimes used to mean the same thing.
      Small airports have only one terminal, while large airports can have several terminals and/or concourses.
      At small airports, the single terminal building usually has all of the functions of a terminal and a concourse.
  </p><p>
Some larger airports have one terminal that is joined to multiple concourses via walkways,
    sky-bridges, or underground tunnels (such as Denver International Airport).
    Some larger airports have more than one terminal, each with one or more concourses
    (such as New York's La Guardia Airport).
    Still other larger airports have multiple terminals each of which includes the functions of a concourse
    (such as Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport).
</p><p>
Most airport terminals are built in a plain style. However, some, such as Baghdad International Airport,
    are grand monuments, while others are considered architectural masterpieces, such as Terminal 1 at
    Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris or Terminal 5 at New York's JFK Airport. A few are designed to
    reflect the culture of an area. The terminal at Albuquerque International Sunport in New Mexico, is designed
    in the Pueblo Revival style made popular by architect John Gaw Meem. The terminal at Bahías de Huatulco
    International Airport in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, which features some palapas that are interconnected to
    form the airport terminal.

<div class="jumbotron">
<h2>Airport Terminal Design</h2>
    <p>Many early terminals were built in the 1930s–1940s when air travel become popular.
        They are often in the art deco style architecture of the time.
        One such example from 1940 is the Houston Municipal Airport Terminal.
        Early airport terminals opened directly onto the tarmac: passengers would walk or take a bus to their aircraft.
        This design is still common among smaller airports.
        Many larger airports have "bus gates" to access aircraft which are parked beyond the main terminal.</p>

</div>
<div class="jumbotron">
     <h3>Pier</h3>
<p>A pier design uses a long, narrow building with aircraft parked on both sides.
    One end joins to a ticketing and baggage claim area. Piers can hold a lot of aircraft and are simple to design.
    They can often result in a long distance from the check-in counter to the gate.
    At Kansai International Airport this distance is half a mile.
    Most large international airports have piers, including Chicago's O'Hare International Airport,
    Larnaca International Airport, Frankfurt International Airport, London Heathrow Airport, Rome Fiumicino Airport,
    Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport,
    Bangkok International Airport, Beirut International Airport, Hong Kong International Airport,
    Allama Iqbal International Airport and Miami International Airport.</p>
</div>

<div class="jumbotron">
     <h3>Satellite Terminal</h3>
<p>A satellite terminal is a building that is not joined to other airport buildings.
    The aircraft can park around the entire building. The first airport to use a satellite terminal was
    London Gatwick Airport. Passengers use an underground tunnel to walk to the satellite from the main terminal.
    This was also the first setup at Los Angeles International Airport, but it has since been changed to a pier layout.
    The first airport to use an automatic people mover to join the main terminal with a satellite was
    Tampa International Airport. Other examples include the following:
<ul><h4>
    <li>Paris's Charles de Gaulle International Airport (Terminal 1)</li>
<li>London Gatwick Airport (South Terminal)</li>
    <li>Orlando International Airport and Pittsburgh International Airport have multi-pier satellite terminals.</li>
    <li>
        At Logan International Airport in Boston, Terminal A has two sections of gates, one of which is a satellite terminal joined by an underground walkway.

        <pclass
        ="w3-padding-32">Delivering passengers bags from A to B sounds easy, but as we all know, it’s very easy
        for things to go wrong and given that passengers spend a lot of time worrying that their bags will go
        astray, baggage management is unsurprisingly a leading investment priority for airlines and airports.
        This Baggage Management is the most advanced, comprehensive and flexible baggage solution ever developed. It
        offers you greater efficiencies, reduced costs and happier passengers. You’ll know precisely where every bag
        in your care is at every step of its journey and, if it should be mishandled, how to return it to its owner
        fast.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color:#263238;">Introduction</h2>
        <p>A Baggage Handling System(BHS) is a type of conveyor installed in airports that
            transports checked luggage from ticket counters to areas where the bags can be loaded onto the airplanes.
            Although the primary function of a BHS is the transportation of bags, a typical BHS will serve other
            functions involved in making sure that a bag gets to the correct location in the airport. The process of
            identifying a bag, and the information associated with it, to make a decision on where the bag should be
            directed within the system is known as sortation. </p>
        <h2 style="color:#263238;">Functions of BHS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Detection of bag jams</li>
            <li>Volume regulation (to ensure that input points are controlled to avoid overloading system)</li>
            <li>Load balancing (to evenly distribute bag volume between conveyor sub-systems)</li>
            <li>Bag counting</li>
            <li>Bag tracking</li>
            <li>Redirection of bags via pusher or diverter</li>
            <li>Automatic Tag Reader (ATR) (Reads the tags on the luggage provided by the airlines)</li>
        </ol>
